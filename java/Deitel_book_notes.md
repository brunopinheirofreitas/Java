#Deitel Book Notes

The main purpose of OOD is to reuse classes, methods, objetcs and atributes in a program. 

###Methods

A method is responsible to execute a task in a code. A **class** is a group of methods for a specific purpose.  

###Instance

A instance generate an object of a class. As an example, a **class** only work when it is instantiated, by doing that a class generate an object. Hence, an object is a instance of a class. 

###Reuse

OOD is great because allow programmers to reuse classes. 

###Messages and calling a method

Everytime a method is called in a code a message is exchanged between the main code and the class that holds the method. 

###Atributes and instance variables 

An attribute detain information about something, in a class the attributes are specified as instance variables. 

###Encapsulation and to hide information 

Classes and their objects encapsulates attributes and methods. Which means, they intrinsicaly hold information such as attributes and methods. 

###Heritage

A new class can inheritade another class. The mother class is called "Superclass" and the child class is called "Subclass".
